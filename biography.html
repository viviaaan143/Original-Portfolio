        <h4>Here's the story...</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Ever since I was young I had loved to create. I would take plain things around my house and turn it into something completely new like using gift tissue paper to create animals or nail polish to paint artwork. My passion for art has always been an outlet for my creativity and it was even more of a joy to give to others.
        <br><br>
        Fast forward to college, I really did not know where life was leading me. I double-majored in dance, because of my deep-rooted passion for it, and criminology, which fascinated my analytical side. I had the best of both worlds and post-college was really daunting since neither routes allowed me to explore both my creativity and analytical skills to the fullest.
        <br><br>
        It wasn’t until I had a conversation with a friend who was in school for UX design. I was amazed at how intentional decisions in design are and its impact on people daily. Only when I searched deeper into the importance of research did I learn to appreciate this field and grow a curiousity.
        </p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <p class="block"> Soon after, I desired to become a designer who would create accessible interfaces and bridge the gap between people and technology.</p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <p>  I enrolled in a design program that helped me understand the thoughtful approach to understanding and listening to needs, eventually crafting a solution. There, I learned the intricacy of each step in the design process and sharpened my skills for user experiences.
	       My involvement in two different worlds, one being artistic and the other more psychological, gives me a unique insight. As an artist and researcher, creating seamless user experiences for people keeps me enthusiastic. UX design allows me to problem solve while also applying my eye for aesthetics. I love exploring what motivates a human and being intentional in decision making. And that’s my story so far.

        <p>Besides design, I have a love for dance, photography, and Christ. In my free time, I also enjoy exploring new places (including new places to eat)!</p>
