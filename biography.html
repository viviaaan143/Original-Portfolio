        <h4>Here's the story...</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Ever since I was young I loved to create. I would take plain things around my house and turn it into something completely new like using gift tissue paper to create animals or nail polish to paint artwork. My passion for art has always been an outlet for my creativity and it was even more of a joy to give to others. When I was younger, I would wait at the salon shop for my mom to finish work. As I sat waiting, I would paint a picture for her clients and coworkers, using the nail polish I had gingerly taken before her appointments. Although it’s a small gesture to give, their smiles of appreciation and warmth filled me up.
        <br><br>
        Fast forward to college, I really did not know where life was leading me. I double-majored with dance, because of my deep-rooted passion for it, and criminology, which fascinated my analytical side. Many people were shocked at my majors because of how different they are and would ask “why?”. I had the best of both worlds and post-college was really daunting to me because neither routes would allow me to explore and grow my creativity and also analytical skills to the fullest. As for work, my experience at law firms gave me the ability to adapt: whether it was providing research to help a case or understanding the clients’ problem and its relation to the law.
        <br><br>
        It wasn’t until I had a conversation with a friend who was in school for UX design. After some research, I had grown such an appreciation and curiosity for this field. I was amazed at how simple decisions impact millions of people daily.</p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <p class="block"> I began to desire to be a designer who can create accessible interfaces and bridge the gap between people and technology.</p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <p> I enrolled in a design program that helped me understand the thoughtful approach to understanding and listening to needs, eventually crafting a solution. There, I learned the intricacy of each step in the design process and sharpened my skills for user experiences.<br><br>
        My involvement in two different worlds, one being artistic and the other more psychological, gives me a unique insight. I can use my skills, grow them, and hone them to better support people. As an artist and researcher, creating seamless user experiences for people keeps me enthusiastic. Just like when I was younger I love using tools and finding innovative ways to use them. UX design allows me to problem solve while also applying my eye for aesthetics. I love exploring what motivates a human and being intentional in problem-solving. It’s exciting that design will always keep me on my toes! I’m used to it!</p>

        <p>Besides design, I have a love for dance, photography, and Christ. In my free time, I also enjoy exploring new places (including new places to eat)!</p>
