          <p class="textreference">"Mentoring Vivian was a fantastic experience! I highly recommend her as a UX/UI designer. I was lucky enough to watch her skills improve week after week and her growth in such a short time has been enormous. I can tell she has grown such a genuine passion for investigating users’ needs and behaviors. I am so impressed by Vivian’s ability to take critical feedback, roll with it, and come back 10x better every single time. She is truly the example I use when I need to demonstrate to others the value of persistence and hard work in design. I wish her all the best and anticipate great things ahead!"</p>

          <p class="titlereference">UX Researcher at Figma, host of Unpacked Angles</p>
          <p class="textreference">"I mentored Vivian during her time in the Bloc UX/UI online design program. During our time together, it was clear that she had a great desire to understand the reasoning behind many of the UX topics we discussed. Even more than that, Vivian expressed great interest in understanding how the UX process played out in the real world, and not just within the constraints of the controlled program environment. She showed a great eye for detail and design as she progressed and was open to collaboration and learning within the front-end development portion of the program. Vivian is inquisitive, creative, and has an incredibly unique background that I believe would make her a fantastic addition to any team and to a field filled with people from all walks of life (that is, UX!)"</p>
