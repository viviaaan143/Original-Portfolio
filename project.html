        <p id="firsttitle" style="font-weight:700;">User Survey</p>
        <p>Knowing that I must first identify what users wanted in a cloud storage application I conducted a survey to see if features such as adding content, creating documents, uploading content, sharing items, and allowing real time collaboration were important to users. This helped identify what the user needs are and focus on these features. First, I identified that most of my participants use cloud storage applications for purposes related to school, photo storage, and sharing content with others.</p>

        <p class= "caption">Interest for organizing content using tags and folders, creating documents, uploading content, sharing items, and real-time collaboration (from left to right). Blue indicates interested, yellow indicates might be interested, and red indicates not interested.</p>
        <p>While the feature of saving content found on the internet only received 61.5% interest, other features like organizing content, creating documents sharing options, uploading, and collaborating had <span class="block2"> interested at least 71.4%</span> of respondents.</p>

        <p>These two personas were derived from trends and patterns in the user surveys. The target market comes from those who use cloud storage for recreational use. Jess is a student who wants to be able to collaborate and grow her connections while Paul, who is older and working, wants to share pictures with family to keep in touch.</p>
        <p class="title">Competitive Analysis</p>
        <section>
          <img class= "ca1" src="images/pinterest.png" alt="Pinterest logo">
          <p>Pinterest is a social media platform that, similarly, allows sharing pictures and videos with goals of creative inspiration. Pinterest is a wonderful platform for businesses actually. Tags allow similar content to be exposed to many users with the same interest. However, there are some weaknesses and threats. According to my research, 71% of Pinterest users are female due to the belief that it has mostly feminine content and does not appeal to male audiences. There are also a few issues with the pins too. Some spammers abuse pins by using misleading links to get more clicks on their profile. Another problem is that some people find it easy to wrongly pin something. This caused me to want to focus on creating an inclusive site and allowing users to control content they post and activity they see such as using the commonly used "like" button signified by a heart.</p>

          <p>Dropbox is a cloud storage site that is used mostly by businesses and freelance professionals. It's a great application because unlike many other sites, you can work offline making it accessible wherever you are. Some weaknesses are the lack of security, limited search function, and users cannot edit in real time. The ability to edit in real time had an interest of 92.9% of people according to the survey so this was a very important feature to have.</p>

          <p class="title">User Flow</p>
          <p>As the user logs in they can upload media to their profile or create a new document. From there they can edit as they wish. Once they finish they will choose their sharing preference: private (only stores their work for their eyes only), public (share with anyone even people without accounts), or collaborate(share with specific people and give them access to edit). After that, they have the option of adding a description or even tags for either themself or others to find easily. They can also add it to a folder to organize content by categories of their choice. Finally, it will be uploaded.</p>

          <p>Results:
            <br>All participants were able to successfully identify pages and complete their tasks. However, some users couldn't tell when they succeeded because feedback was too subtle and there was no obvious button to perform the function of adding content. </p>

The logo is the shape of a paint holder to reinforce the site's purpose to serve artists. </p>

          <p>Besides adding color to my high fidelity wireframe, I creating a large "add" button at the top for users to easily identify, which did prove to be more effective. Also, I got rid of the option to edit a picture, because that was not a problem I was trying to solve, so I had to regear my thoughts back to the issues at hand. Users were able to quickly complete their tasks this time around. The biggest feedback I got from this test was about the new options. I changed the wording from "create new" to "new document" and "upload new" to "upload image". I also changed the three options to be visually equal.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <section class="conclusion">
        <br><br>
        <p>All in all, I've learned so much! The layout is simple and achieves the goal of a consistent branding feel. I learned how to develop this through playing with colors and different logo iterations. It's important to not get attached to one idea. I had really loved a different logo I made previously. However, users couldn't identify what the logo was and if it were to be scaled down to a favicon the logo would be indistinguishable. I had to let go of this idea that worked so well in my mind and find an alternative for users to easily identify and associate with the brand. Branding is vital when communicating to audiences. I appreciate how dependable usability tests are: if something isn't working for your users, it isn't working so learn to adapt. The more user testing, the better!
        Looking in retrospect, I would have also added more tasks to my usability test such as "While on the homepage how could you tell if you are following someone or not?" This would help me understand the strengths and weaknesses of other features. </p>
